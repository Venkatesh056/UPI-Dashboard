# 🚀 UPI Transactions Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions.  
The dashboard provides insights into transaction behaviour, payment channel adoption, verification performance, and fraud-related risk indicators.

The objective of this project is to transform raw UPI transaction data into **meaningful analytical insights** using data modelling, DAX measures, and advanced visualizations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

With the rapid adoption of UPI, understanding transaction patterns, channel usage, verification efficiency, and potential risk signals is critical.  
Raw datasets alone do not easily reveal actionable insights.

This project aims to analyze UPI transaction data to identify behavioural trends, ecosystem dynamics, and risk indicators through interactive Power BI visualizations.
